// I initially used a regular for-loop with conditions to find the driver, but I asked a friend / did research on if this would be the most concise way.
// I decided java.util.optional using a stream.We take list of drivers and convert into stream. This work like a conveyor , bringing data forward,much like iterating.
// Filter method - picking out drivers that match our requested location â€“ pulling all the matched locations.
// Min method. Chose minimum load from pulled drivers
// This makes the code  shorter, concise and is cleaner code.
